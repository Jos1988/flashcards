>Q: In python create an object that represents a question, which includes a correct answer, number of times correctly answered and number of times incorrectly answered.

A: Here is an example of how you could create an object in Python that represents a question with a correct answer and tracking for the number of times the question has been correctly and incorrectly answered:

```
class Question:

    def __init__(self, question, correct_answer):
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        else:
            self.num_incorrect += 1
            return False
```

This class has a constructor method (__init__) that initializes the question and correct answer for each instance of the Question class. It also initializes the num_correct and num_incorrect counters to 0. The check_answer method takes in a user's answer as an argument and compares it to the correct answer. If the user's answer is correct, it increments the num_correct counter and returns True, otherwise it increments the num_incorrect counter and returns False.

Here's an example of how you could use this class:

```
q = Question("What is the capital of France?", "Paris")
print(q.check_answer("Paris")) # prints True
print(q.check_answer("London")) # prints False
print(q.num_correct) # prints 1
print(q.num_incorrect) # prints 1
```

>Q: Remove the else statement.

A: To remove the else statement from the check_answer method in the Question class, you can simply return False outside of the if block, like this:

```
class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, correct_answer):
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        self.num_incorrect += 1
        return False
```
This will still increment the num_incorrect counter when the user's answer is incorrect, but it will not execute the return False statement inside the else block. Instead, it will execute the return False statement outside of the if block.

Here's an example of how you could use this modified version of the Question class:

```
q = Question("What is the capital of France?", "Paris")
print(q.check_answer("Paris")) # prints True
print(q.check_answer("London")) # prints False
print(q.num_correct) # prints 1
print(q.num_incorrect) # prints 1
```

>Q: Create a function that loads questions from a csv.

A: Here is an example of how you could create a function that loads questions from a CSV file and returns them as a list of Question objects:

```
import csv

def load_questions(filename):
    questions = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            question = row[0]
            correct_answer = row[1]
            q = Question(question, correct_answer)
            questions.append(q)
    return questions
```

This function takes a file name as an argument and reads the CSV file line by line using a csv.reader object. It creates a new Question object for each row in the CSV file, with the question and correct answer taken from the first and second columns, respectively. It then appends the Question object to a list of questions, which it returns at the end.

The CSV file should have two columns, with the question in the first column and the correct answer in the second column.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:

```
questions = load_questions("questions.csv")
for q in questions:
    print(q.question)
    user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
    result = q.check_answer(user_answer)
    if result:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print("Incorrect.")
This code would read a list of questions from the "questions.csv" file, prompt the user to answer each question, and then check the user's answer using the check_answer method of the Question class. It would print "Correct!" if the answer is correct and "Incorrect." if the answer is incorrect.
```

>Q: Put this in a main function.

A: Here is an example of how you could put the code for loading and answering questions in a main function:

```
import csv

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, correct_answer):
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        self.num_incorrect += 1
        return False

def load_questions(filename):
    questions = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            question = row[0]
            correct_answer = row[1]
            q = Question(question, correct_answer)
            questions.append(q)
    return questions

def main():
    questions = load_questions("questions.csv")
    for q in questions:
        print(q.question)
        user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
        result = q.check_answer(user_answer)
        if result:
            print("Correct!")
        else:
            print("Incorrect.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines the Question class and the load_questions function, as well as a main function that loads the questions from a CSV file and prompts the user to answer each question. It then checks the user's answer using the check_answer method of the Question class and prints "Correct!" if the answer is correct or "Incorrect." if the answer is incorrect.

The main function is called at the end of the code, after a check for __name__ == "__main__". This allows the code to be imported into another module without running the main function automatically.

>Q: Now save the results.

A: To save the results of the quiz, you can modify the main function to write the results to a file after the user has completed all the questions. Here is an example of how you could do this:

```
import csv

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, correct_answer):
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        self.num_incorrect += 1
        return False

def load_questions(filename):
    questions = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            question = row[0]
            correct_answer = row[1]
            q = Question(question, correct_answer)
            questions.append(q)
    return questions

def main():
    questions = load_questions("questions.csv")
    for q in questions:
        print(q.question)
        user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
        result = q.check_answer(user_answer)
        if result:
            print("Correct!")
        else:
            print("Incorrect.")

    # Write results to a file
    with open("results.txt", "w") as f:
        for q in questions:
            f.write(f"{q.question}: {q.num_correct} correct, {q.num_incorrect} incorrect\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This modified version of the main function opens a file called "results.txt" in write mode after the user has completed all the questions. It then iterates through the list of questions and writes a line to the file with the question and the number of times it was correctly and incorrectly answered.

The file will contain a line for each question in the following format:

```
Question: num_correct correct, num_incorrect incorrect
```
For example, if the user answered the first question correctly and the second question incorrectly, the results file would contain the following two lines:

```
What is the capital of France?: 1 correct, 0 incorrect
What is the capital of the UK?: 0 correct, 1 incorrect
```

>Q: Refactor this code to be object orientated.

Here is an example of how you could refactor the code to be fully object-oriented:

```
import csv

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question, correct_answer):
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer):
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        self.num_incorrect += 1
        return False

class Quiz:
    def __init__(self, questions):
        self.questions = questions

    def take_quiz(self):
        for q in self.questions:
            print(q.question)
            user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
            result = q.check_answer(user_answer)
            if result:
                print("Correct!")
            else:
                print("Incorrect.")

    def save_results(self, filename):
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            for q in self.questions:
                f.write(f"{q.question}: {q.num_correct} correct, {q.num_incorrect} incorrect\n")

def load_questions(filename):
    questions = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            question = row[0]
            correct_answer = row[1]
            q = Question(question, correct_answer)
            questions.append(q)
    return questions

def main():
    questions = load_questions("questions.csv")
    quiz = Quiz(questions)
    quiz.take_quiz()
    quiz.save_results("results.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

This refactored code defines two classes: Question and Quiz. The Question class is the same as in the previous examples and represents a single question with a correct answer and counters for the number of times it has been correctly and incorrectly answered.

The Quiz class has a constructor that takes a list of Question objects as an argument and stores them in an instance variable. It also has two methods: take_quiz and save_results. The take_quiz method iterates through the list of questions and prompts the user to answer each question, then checks the answer using the check_answer method of the Question class. The save_results method writes the results of the quiz to a file, with a line for each question in the following format:

```
Question: num_correct correct, num_incorrect incorrect
```

The main function creates a list of Question objects by calling the load_questions function, then creates a Quiz object and calls the take_quiz and save_results methods on it. This allows the entire quiz-taking and result-saving process to be encapsulated within the Quiz class, making the code more modular and easier to reuse.

>Q: Add type hints.

Here is the previous example with type hints added:

```
import csv
from typing import List, Tuple

class Question:
    def __init__(self, question: str, correct_answer: str) -> None:
        self.question = question
        self.correct_answer = correct_answer
        self.num_correct = 0
        self.num_incorrect = 0

    def check_answer(self, user_answer: str) -> bool:
        if user_answer == self.correct_answer:
            self.num_correct += 1
            return True
        self.num_incorrect += 1
        return False

class Quiz:
    def __init__(self, questions: List[Question]) -> None:
        self.questions = questions

    def take_quiz(self) -> None:
        for q in self.questions:
            print(q.question)
            user_answer = input("Enter your answer: ")
            result = q.check_answer(user_answer)
            if result:
                print("Correct!")
            else:
                print("Incorrect.")

    def save_results(self, filename: str) -> None:
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            for q in self.questions:
                f.write(f"{q.question}: {q.num_correct} correct, {q.num_incorrect} incorrect\n")

def load_questions(filename: str) -> List[Question]:
    questions = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        for row in reader:
            question = row[0]
            correct_answer = row[1]
            q = Question(question, correct_answer)
            questions.append(q)
    return questions

def main() -> None:
    questions = load_questions("questions.csv")
    quiz = Quiz(questions)
    quiz.take_quiz()
    quiz.save_results("results.txt")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this version of the code, type hints have been added to the arguments and return values of the functions and methods. For example, the __init__ method of the Question class has the following type hint for its arguments:

```
def __init__(self, question: str, correct_answer: str) -> None:
```

This indicates that the question and correct_answer arguments should be strings, and the method does not return a value (hence the return type of None).

Type hints can help make the code more readable and easier to understand, and they can also be used by static type checkers like mypy to catch type errors before the code is run.
