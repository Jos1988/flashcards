This is a simple script to quiz myself for a test.

The initial code was written by openai's GPT 3.5 model. Check out the `conversation_with_GPT.md` file to see the full chat and the `openai` folder to see the program written by openai. 

The quiz in the main folder is an adaptation of the openai version. 

## How to run the quiz. 

1. Add your questions and answers to the `data\questions` folder (see the example in there).
2. Run the quiz from the console: `> python quiz.py`. Or run the /quiz.py file any way you see fit.
3. Name of the quiz is the name of the questions file you want to use.
